<hr class="tiny">

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I.</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A TALL clock in the hall was striking eleven.
A tired, but very wide-awake, little girl was
climbing the stairs. “Land sakes, child! Hear
that? Go straight to sleep now. It’s wicked for
grown folks to be up this time of night, say
nothing of young ’uns.”</p>

<p>The child made no reply. She had nothing to
say. Older people than Chee have <i>learned</i> to be
silent; in her case, lessons had been unnecessary.
Softly closing her chamber door, Chee blew out
the little flame that had lighted her way up the
creaking stairs. Instead of going <i>straight to sleep</i>,
she sat down by the open window and began to
unbraid her long, stiff hair. Impatiently she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
stopped, and clenched her brown hands. Her
cheeks burned as she broke out in bitter whispers,
“Oh, the music! The music! And Aunt Mean
called it wicked. It wasn’t wicked. It was lovely.
It made me want to fly right up to heaven. Guess
things that make you feel that way aren’t wicked.
She couldn’t have heard it much,” continued the
child, excitedly. “She was watching the people in
front of us, and ’zaminin’ their clothes. Told
Uncle Reuben how many different kinds of stuffs
were on Mrs. Snow’s bonnet; and that beautiful,
beautiful song going on all the while. It wasn’t
wicked! The choir at church isn’t wicked, and this
is fifty times nicer. ’Sides—” Her hands dropped
limply to her lap. Her eyes lifted from their watch
down the road which lay white and smooth in the
moonlight, the shadows of the trees crouching
dark on either side. Gazing up at the stars she
continued, tenderly, “My Daddy Joe made music
on one. He called it his ‘dear old fiddle,’ he
loved it so. No, it can’t be wicked.”</p>

<p>With the thought of Daddy Joe came a new
grievance. “And I just won’t let any one hurt it,
either, I won’t. I love it, too. If Aunt Mean<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
knew, she’d call me wicked, but she sha’n’t know—ever.
I’ll make out I didn’t like the concert,
so she can’t guess. No, I won’t, either, I suppose
that ’ud be a lie. I just won’t say anything ’tall
about it, ’cause I did like it. Oh, how I liked it,
though! Still, I most wish there had been some
one for me to stay with, so’s I couldn’t have gone,
’cause now I’ll wish and wish for always to hear
some more.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t mind so much about the girl in a
white dress that sang those songs, or the man who
played on the black organ, somethin’ like the one
at Sunday school, only blacker and sweeter—it’s
the fiddle I mind. It sounded like the river when
it rubs against the little stones and tumbles over
the rocks; and pretty soon it seemed just like the
stream by the mill-dam, so big and strong-like,
with it’s mind all made up. And then, by and by,
it whispered. I wanted to cry then,—it was funny
when I liked it so, too,—it whispered ever and
ever so low, like the leaves talk together just before
the rain falls, almost just like a violet smell
could be if it made any noise.”</p>

<p>The moon was rising above the trees. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
beauty of the mill-stream music was forgotten for
the murmuring leaf sounds. A softer mood stole
over her heart, stilling its turmoil.</p>

<p>Chee laid her head against the window-frame.
Lower and lower it drooped, until it rested on the
sill. The moon had disappeared when she awoke.
The road was swallowed up in blackness. The
room was so dark she could not see her little bed.
She felt around, found it, and crept in. Still,
sweet, far-off strains echoed through her dreams,
bringing a smile—half-rapt, half-yearning.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II.</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was scarcely daylight. A small white figure
was picking its way, barefooted, across the dusty
attic floor. It paused beside an old-fashioned, hair-covered
trunk. Chee’s waking thought had been of
the wonderful concert. Led by some unconscious
motive, she had sought the loft for a sight of
Daddy Joe’s fiddle. Raising the lid of the trunk,
she slowly drew forth one article after another,—a
scarlet shawl with little glistening beads fastened
in its fringe, a pair of moccasins, a heavy Indian
blanket wrought in gay colors, a silken scarf. She
thoughtfully stroked the rich goods of the scarf
and slipped her feet into the moccasins. “My
mamma’s feet were most’s little’s mine,” she said,
in the customary whisper of her reveries.</p>

<p>Spying a small box, she pulled it out and opened
it. Across its cover was printed in large, uneven
letters, “Mamma’s Playthings.” Lovingly she took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
in her arms a much worn corn-cob dolly; only a
few streaks of paint were left for its face, only
a few wisps of hair for its wig. She handled some
little acorn cups and saucers as though they had
been the frailest of china. Then, with a sigh, she
remembered what had brought her to the attic,
and laid aside several rudely moulded figures of
clay. The trunk was almost emptied of its contents
before she drew forth a battered violin case,
opened it, and with reverent hands lifted out Daddy
Joe’s fiddle. The bridge had slipped; instinctively
she straightened it. “My Daddy Joe’s own
dear fiddle.” Closing her eyes, she tried to remember
how he had looked with the violin under
his chin. Perhaps, after all, imagination as well
as memory painted the picture before her,—her
father’s tall, straight form as he drew the bow
across the strings; a fainter vision of the gaily
blanketed woman by his side.</p>

<p>“And I was there, too,” she murmured, dreamily
fingering a string of Indians beads that hung
around her neck. For some reason Aunt Mean
has never taken these away from her. With a fold
of her night-robe she began to polish the instrument.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
In doing so she disturbed one of its yellow
strings. A low, trembling note vibrated through
the loft. Chee’s face glowed. She would make
music for herself. Why had she not thought of
that before? In her delight, the child put both
her arms around the old violin and passionately
hugged it.</p>

<p>Taking the bow from its place, she said, “I’ll
find the way they do it. I’ll begin this very night.
Nobody shall hear it, ’cause they’re way downstairs.
’Sides, they’ll be asleep.”</p>

<p>Chee trembled with excitement. “I’ll hide it
where I can find it in the dark,” she continued,
stealthily, “so Aunt Mean’ll never know. She’d
most kill me if she found out. I wonder why her
mother named her such a name. Maybe she
guessed what she’d be like when she got old, like
the squaws used to long ago, or maybe it only just
happened to fit her.” With these meditations she
carefully hid the old violin box behind a chest.</p>

<p>Miss Almeana Whittaker, the while, was placidly
untying her nightcap. (Nightcaps were still useful
to Miss Almeana.) She was not in the least suspicious
that her heathen niece, as she chose to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
call her, was awake at this early hour. She often
told her brother that children kicked against going
to bed at night, and might just as well kick about
getting up in the morning. To Chee, she would
say, “Go to bed so’s to get up.”</p>

<p>“Chee! Chee!” came from the stairway.</p>

<p>“Yes, Aunt, I’m awake.”</p>

<p>“What’s struck her to wake this early?” she
asked, but that was the last she thought of it.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III.</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">OH, the excitement of the days that followed
that memorable concert! The pleasure, to
Chee, of a secret all her own! The attempts and
failures to <i>make music</i>! She was not even familiar
with the beginnings of melody; if she had heard of
a scale, she did not known its meaning. So, for
awhile, she tried with her little, trembling fingers,
to draw tones from the old, loosened strings.</p>

<p>After repeated trials and no music, she grew
discouraged; even her untrained ear found something
very, very wrong. “It’s the fiddle,” she
concluded, “it’s too old. It won’t work. If I
only had a new one now, brandy-new from the
store, I know I could do it. I hear lots of songs
in my head, but I can’t hear them in the fiddle.”
However, the idea that the violin was too old was
soon corrected.</p>

<p>One Sunday morning Chee sat in church, thinking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
there must be baby birds just outside a window
near. The songs the old birds were singing made
her think so. It had been a bright day, but for
a moment the sky was clouded.</p>

<p>“What a terrible big bird Culloo<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> must be to
hide the whole sun! There, he’s gone now. I do
hope he will stay away.” Chee shuddered a little.
Aunt Mean frowned at her from the end of the
pew. She could not understand her niece’s fanciful,
almost superstitious ideas. It was not strange
that so sensitive a nature as Chee’s, of which the
fantastic beliefs of her mother’s race were a prominent
part, could have little in common with the
blunt, doctrinal mind of Aunt Mean.</p>

<p>All the little sounds of the outdoor world had
each a separate individuality for Chee. The tall,
stiff poplars in the churchyard, mingling their
metallic rustle with the dainty murmur of the willows,
caused Aunt Mean to think, “I guess it’s
going to blow up a storm, the trees air a-rattling.”</p>

<p>“The poplars are singing with the willows,”
thought Chee. “Their voices sound together just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
like little Sadie’s and her grandpa’s when they
stand up to sing.” Sadie was a dear, wee tot of a
girl, with soft, flying hair. She sat in the pew
ahead of Miss Almeana. Her grandpa was a tall,
stiff-jointed old gentleman. He wore a very long,
shiny coat, and, no matter how warm the day, there
was a turkey-red scarf around his neck. His eyes
were small, and glinted like steel. His nose was
thin and straight, and his face always pale. When
he left his pew he immediately put on a high silk
hat. Nor did he consider himself in church until
he had reached his old-fashioned seat and closed its
door.</p>

<p>Chee did not like the grandpa very well, he
made her feel chilly, she said; but often she longed
to change her own stiff, jetty hair for Sadie’s fuzzy
curls. Her thoughts of the birds and the trees and
Sadie’s curls were suddenly checked by Mr. Green,
the minister, who was saying, “It is something
like a violin—the older it grows, and the oftener
it is used, the more valuable it becomes.”</p>

<p>Chee instantly straightened herself in her seat.
“Did he mean the older it is the better it plays?
How could he? How funny! Other things wear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
out, why don’t fiddles? Guess he must be mistaken,
’cause ’less Daddy Joe’s is too old, what can
be the trouble? Wouldn’t the minister think I
was wicked, though, if he knew I loved it like
I do? I s’pose ’course he would, ’cause he’s Aunt
Mean’s minister.”</p>

<p>That Aunt Mean could have a minister who did
not think just as she, never occurred to Chee.</p>

<p>“But if I could only make him promise not to
tell, he couldn’t—ever, ’cause he’s a minister.”</p>

<p>A few evenings longer she struggled on. The
same discordant tones were the only result. One
night the horrible sounds were more than she could
bear. With a shiver, she put away the naughty
fiddle. Baffled and broken-hearted, she crept
down to her room. “What shall I do? Oh, what
shall I do?”</p>

<p>Worn out, she threw herself on the floor, and
did something very unusual for Chee—she began
to cry. “Nobody can help me. I’m all ’lone.
Nobody’s here ’cept Our Father, I s’pose He’s here,
’cause He’s always everywhere; but I don’t feel Him
very much anywhere. Any way, He wouldn’t make
music for me. He used to for Musmi and his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
friends, but perhaps He isn’t so fond of music as
He used to be when they lived.”</p>

<p>The thought of heavenly music fascinated her.
“I wish I was an angel, I do. I’d dare ask Him
then, any way. He used to do such things for
people in the stories Daddy told me. But Mr.
Green only says He can make us good and such
things. I wonder,” she said, slowly, trying to
grasp a new idea, “I wonder if He couldn’t
make Mr. Green think the fiddle isn’t wicked.
If He could only do that so I knew Mr. Green
wouldn’t tell Aunt Mean, I could ask him about
old fiddles being as good as new.”</p>

<p>She still lay on the floor. Looking up at the
faintly blinking stars, she murmured, “I don’t
believe it would be wrong to ask Our Father to
try, ’cause Our Father and I know the fiddle
isn’t wicked, even if Aunt Mean and the minister
don’t. I am going to ask Him, any way, this very
night.”</p>

<p>This resolution seemed to comfort her. Beginning
to undress, she tried to think out a prayer.
Poor little Chee! She did not realize that as
she had been lying on the floor, looking up at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
stars, her heart had offered its petition. So she
kept on framing a prayer that had already been
heard.</p>

<p>At last, kneeling by her bed, she said over the
carefully chosen words, “Our Father, who art in
heaven and everywhere, I love Daddy Joe’s fiddle
very much. Better even than the real china tea-set
that Cousin Gertrude sent me, or my string of
beads. But I can’t make music on it, I’m afraid
it’s too old. Mr. Green said it couldn’t be, but I’m
afraid I didn’t understand him right. I want to
ask him. Can’t Thou make him not call me
wicked, nor Daddy Joe, nor ever tell Aunt Mean,
’cause Thou knows how mad she’d be.” Chee
paused. This was the prayer she had planned,
but something seemed lacking. After a moment
she added, “And if Thou do, I’ll do something for
Thee sometime, only I can’t think of anything now.
Thy kingdom come. And finally save us. Amen.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV.</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">NEXT day Chee plucked up courage and said,
“Aunt Mean, please may I pick a bunch of
white peonies and carry’em down to Mrs. Green?”
Aunt Mean was straightening the rag-carpet rugs
on the kitchen floor. “Take hold the end of
this mat, Chee. Well, I don’t know, seems like
you wanted to be on the go the hull time. Only
last week you rode over to the ‘Corners’ with your
uncle, and ’tain’t a month since you was took to a
reg’ler concert—in the town hall, too. But I
don’t know but you might as well go, an’ stop on
the way an’ ask Mis’ Snow for that apern pat’en
she said she’d just’s liev I took.”</p>

<p>“Yes’um,” and Chee bounded away to gather
her flowers.</p>

<p>“Beats all, that child does, still’s a mouse inside,
wild’s a deer the minute she’s out.” This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
had been spoken to a neighbor who had “jest
dropped in a minute.”</p>

<p>“Well, I s’pose it’s her Injun blood, isn’t it?”
was the reply. “What a worry she must be to
you, Miss Almeana. She’s well brung up, though,
if she is half savage, I will say that.”</p>

<p>“Poor Joe’s runnin’ off an’ marryin’ was a dretful
thing,” stated Aunt Mean, “dretful for him,
and dretful for us.”</p>

<p>“No doubt she was purty, and I s’pose findin’
she’d lived so long with a white family made some
difference,” the neighbor remarked. There was a
shadow of romance about her nature; there was
not even that about Aunt Mean’s.</p>

<p>“It was better’n though he’d found her naked in
a wigwam, but ’twas bad ’nough,” dryly returned
poor Joe’s sister.</p>

<p>“Prob’ly the greatest attraction was her voice.
It must have been purty hard on so good Meth’dist
people as you an’ Reuben be, to have one of your
own kin go roun’ fiddlin’ fer shows with an Injun
singin’ woman fer his wife.”</p>

<p>Miss Almeana did not consider it proper to tell
what an affliction this had been to her, but with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
a clear conscience she told, for at least the fiftieth
time, how Reuben “took on.” After that came
poor brother Joe’s taking on; how, when his wife
died, he left his profession to wander about the
world, clinging to his baby girl for comfort in his
loneliness; how, at last, he came back to the old
homestead, sick—body and heart. “He only
lived a couple o’ years longer, and most o’ that
time he set round with the young’n in his arms,”
went on Aunt Mean.</p>

<p>The neighbor had heard it all before, but she
was interested.</p>

<p>“Reuben thinks that more’n half what killed
him was heartbroke’ness. Mebbe it was. He was
allers kinder soft like, and that old fiddle of his’n
only made him wuss. I used to hate the sight on
it. Think of the waste o’ money! Sold his whole
half the farm to buy it—meadow lot and all. I
tell you what, I chucked that thing out o’ sight
mighty sudden after he died.”</p>

<p>“Did you burn it,” asked her listener, in an
awed voice, “after he had loved it so?” Aunt
Mean quailed a little.</p>

<p>“Laws! no, Mis’ Bowman, I ain’t quite so Spartan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
as that. I didn’t have courage. But I stuck
it up attic for good and all. It never’ll come down
as long as I keep house here, either.”</p>

<p>“Well, I must say, Miss Almeana,” interrupted
her acquaintance, anxious to appease the old lady,
“you don’t work the child very hard. What does
she do, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“She? Oh, what I tell her to. It’s easier to
do most everything yourself than be botherin’
round with children. She’s coming on nine,
though, and I don’t want it on my conscience
that I didn’t do my duty by her—if she is a
heathen—so I s’pose it’s about time I broke
her in.”</p>

<p>Perhaps a very faint vision of what Chee’s
<i>breaking in</i> might mean, rose before the neighbor’s
mental sight, for she said, in relenting tones,
“Oh, well, I don’t see’s you’ve any cause to hurry.
She’s right smart and will learn mighty fast when
she once starts in.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” said Aunt Mean, and Mrs. Bowman
never quite made up her mind whether she had
helped Chee’s cause or not.</p>

<p>While the housewives gossipped, the little girl<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
was wending her way to the clergyman’s house.
She did not walk very fast. It was warm and
dusty, and she was busily thinking. After all, she
was somewhat loath to reach her destination. At
last she came to the small, white parsonage. Her
heart seemed to pound as loudly as her hand as
she knocked upon the door. The minister’s wife
herself answered the knock.</p>

<p>“Aunt Mean sent you these.”</p>

<p>“Why, thank you, Chee, thank you. And such
a hot day, too. Would you like a drink of water?”
Instead of water, the lady brought a glass of milk
from the cellar. Chee sipped it slowly. It was
delicious after the long, hot walk, but she felt
anxious over her errand.</p>

<p>“I hope he won’t think I’ve workings of a spirit
like Deacon Herring had,” she thought, a little
fearfully.</p>

<p>After Mrs. Green had asked for her uncle and
aunt, if they had green corn yet, and if Miss
Almeana’s currant-bushes would be heavy that
year, conversation flagged. Chee still sat on the
edge of her chair as though waiting for something
to happen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>“What can ail the child?” wondered Mrs.
Green. Finally she ventured to ask Chee if she
had come on any special errand.</p>

<p>“No-o, not ’zactly an errand, but—but,” she
hesitated, slowly twisting around her fingers the
hem of her short gingham skirt. “Could—please
do you care if I see the minister a minute?”</p>

<p>Her hostess laughed. “Care? Why, no, child.
I don’t keep him put away in the dark.”</p>

<p>Chee’s black eyes looked frightened. “Oh, Mrs.
Green!” she said, “I didn’t mean it that way.”
Dropping her voice to a whisper, she entreated,
“Don’t say anything to Aunt Mean. Please don’t
tell.”</p>

<p>The lady’s kind heart was touched. She loved
little children. Quickly stooping to kiss Chee’s
flushed forehead, she answered, “Tell that you
asked to see the minister? No, indeed.”</p>

<p>“Thank you.” Chee had forgotten for a moment
her usual reserve, and stealing her arms
around Mrs. Green’s neck, she softly kissed her.
This was the first voluntary act of affection the
child had shown toward any one since her father’s
death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>Though the minister’s wife only remarked in a
gentle voice, “I think my husband is up in the hay-mow—there
is a nice breeze by the door,” she was
ever after, to Chee, the ideal of a mother hardly
remembered.</p>

<p>While leading her to the barn, the lady asked,
“Do you mind going up by yourself?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no,” answered the little girl. It would
be easier to confront the minister alone.</p>

<p>Chee found him lying on the hay with a book
over his eyes. She furtively peeped at him several
times from the top of the ladder. Finally she concluded
he was not asleep.</p>

<p>“Mr. Green,” she called. Her voice was not
high and clear like most children’s; it was
strangely deep and rich. “Mr. Green,” she repeated.</p>

<p>He looked over his book, exclaiming, “Why,
child, how you startled me!” Then in a gentler
voice he added, “What brought you here, Little
One?”</p>

<p>The pet name helped to ease her fluttering
heart. She stepped nearer and quietly studied
his face a minute.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>“Can you keep a secret?” she asked, still
watching him closely.</p>

<p>He was amused with his little visitor and replied,
“For how long?”</p>

<p>“Forever,” came the instant, firm reply.</p>

<p>Something in the child’s earnest face at once
sobered the minister.</p>

<p>“That depends, Miss Chee,” he answered.</p>

<p>Chee seated herself beside him on the hay. She
had forgotten to be afraid.</p>

<p>“Mr. Green,”—the bead-like eyes enlarged, and
seemed to soften as she spoke,—“you are a minister,
and if you once promise you can’t break your
word—ever, can you?”</p>

<p>“Not and be a true minister, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Then won’t you promise?”</p>

<p>“I guess so.”</p>

<p>“This is a ’portant matter. ‘Guess so’ won’t
do. Say ‘yes,’ please.”</p>

<p>“Well, yes, then, little lawyer.” Though just
what he was promising was not clear to him, it
brought a thoughtful, satisfied expression to Chee’s
face as, looking down, she sat absently crumpling
hay.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe37_5" id="i032">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i032.jpg" alt="THIS IS A ’PORTANT MATTER">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">“‘THIS IS A ’PORTANT MATTER. “GUESS SO” WON’T DO. SAY “YES,” PLEASE’”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>“And what about the secret?” asked the clergyman,
after some moments of silence.</p>

<p>She looked up quickly. She had been busy
pondering how far she should explain matters, and
had half forgotten his presence.</p>

<p>“Why, you know, you said old ones were lots
better than new ones, but I am afraid you were
mistaken, for Daddy Joe’s is very, very bad.”</p>

<p>“What are you talking about, child?”</p>

<p>“Why, you said it your very own self, you did.”
Here was a new difficulty. “A minister can’t
back out of what he said. And you said it, sir.
Don’t you remember that Sunday you preached
that old ones were better than the new ones?
Please think hard.”</p>

<p>“Old what?”</p>

<p>“Why, old fiddles. You said so.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, suppose I did. It’s a well-known
fact, little girl.”</p>

<p>“I did understand right, after all, then? But
what can be the matter with Daddy Joe’s?”</p>

<p>Mr. Green looked more perplexed. “I don’t
yet quite understand you, Chee. Suppose you
begin at the beginning, and tell me all about it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>So Chee commenced, growing more and more
interested in her own story as she went on, for
were not the minister’s eyes smiling into hers as
if to say, “You came to the very right person,
little Chee—the very right person.”</p>

<p>“Then I promised Our Father faithfully,” she
continued, telling of the night before when she had
resolved to consult the minister, “that if He’d do
that for me I’d do something for Him. And I
will, honest, for He did hear me,” she concluded
by saying, in a hushed, reverent voice.</p>

<p>Her listener happened to be searching about for
his handkerchief just then. The disturbance in
the hay caused the dust to fly. This brought
moisture to his eyes. Chee gravely offered her
small square of linen.</p>

<p>When she had finished telling all about her
Daddy Joe’s fiddle, he said, gaily, “I am not much
of a musician, but long ago when I was in college
I owned a violin. It must be in the house somewhere,
now. I’ll hunt it up, and tell you what
little I know about it.”</p>

<p>Chee’s eyes shone more brightly. Catching
hold of her new friend’s sleeve,—he had risen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
to go down the ladder,—she said, her voice deep
with emotion, “I wish I could thank you more
than tongue can tell.” It was not a very elaborate
thank you, but the glow in her eyes made up any
loss of words.</p>

<p>“I never before saw a child so thoroughly in
earnest,” he mused. “She must possess an exceedingly
passionate nature, or else be extraordinarily
fond of music.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear! Aunt Mean’ll miss me. It’s getting
so late, and she won’t let me come again
in a long, long time.” But even as she spoke in
a troubled way, a smile broke over her face. “He
fixed it before,” she said, reverently, “I’ll ask
Him again.”</p>

<p>The minister understood, and many a day, when
his burdens were heavy, he recalled the faith of
a little half-Indian child.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V.</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was Sunday. The morning sermon was ended,
and the choir-leader had played the “walkout,”
as Chee termed the postlude.</p>

<p>The choir-leader was a very interesting person.
He not only led the singing and played the organ
at church, but could whistle. And such whistling!
Not the every-day wood-pile sort, but the kind that
made every boy in town his friend.</p>

<p>He was tall, had a sallow, haggard face and
hollow eyes. His spare locks almost touched
his shoulders, and appeared to be faded. One
knew at a second glance, however, they had never
been brighter.</p>

<p>This eccentric-looking gentleman had hardly
slipped from off the long bench before the organ,
ere the minister had found Aunt Mean and was
saying, “Will you kindly do Mrs. Green and myself
a favor?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>“You know very well, Elder, any living thing on
our farm is at your disposal. If I’ve said it once,
I have said it a hundred times!”</p>

<p>“Well, it is something from your farm, to be
sure. We want your little niece for a day—say
Wednesday, if it is pleasant.”</p>

<p>“Chee?” she exclaimed, with surprise. “For
mercy’s sake, what do you want o’ her?”</p>

<p>“You know how fond of children we are—both
of us. We want her to enjoy her. Surely, you
can spare the child for a single day.”</p>

<p>“It ain’t the sparin’ on her.” But catching sight
of Chee’s pleading eyes, she added, “I don’t want
no niece o’ mine botherin’ round and makin’ Mrs.
Green a heap o’ work.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed, Chee would be a real help. You
know, Miss Whittaker, a home without a child is
often a lonely place.”</p>

<p>“Some folks ain’t had much chance to find out,
lately,” and Aunt Mean went off with her favorite
“Humph.”</p>

<p>For awhile after that eventful visit, matters
went more smoothly for Chee.</p>

<p>She was taught how to tighten the strings of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
violin until they formed chords, and how to play
scales upon them. Her eyes opened wide with
astonishment.</p>

<p>“To think the dear old fiddle hasn’t been to
blame, after all!” she joyfully cried. “Just
me!”</p>

<p>It was a great revelation to her to find the
strings had always to be brought up to a certain
pitch. “Why, no wonder Daddy Joe’s couldn’t
play if they have to be pulled up every time,” she
exclaimed, then added, plaintively, “It’s years
and years since Daddy’s pulled up his.”</p>

<p>“Of course it’s no wonder,” laughed her teacher,
fingering the companion of his boyhood days.
“Even the strings on this are yellow from lying
in a paper so long. What must your father’s be
like? It’s a great marvel that they have not
snapped before this. No, no, little one, don’t condemn
the instrument, but keep right on trying to
understand it.”</p>

<p>Chee, with a light heart, bade the minister and
his wife good-by. She had begun to learn how to
make music. And were not a whole package of
violin-strings in her pocket?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>After this it became more natural for the pastor
to say Sundays, “May we have Chee to-morrow,
Miss Whittaker?” Or, “Mrs. Green wishes me
to engage your little niece for Thursday,” and Aunt
Mean seldom refused.</p>

<p>Chee never quite understood why permission was
so readily given. Secretly she puzzled over it, but
was far too grateful to ask questions.</p>

<p>The truth of the matter is this—it flattered
Aunt Mean to have the minister intimate with her
little relative. Moreover, she had an indescribable
notion that by allowing her niece to frequent the
parsonage, she might in some way counterbalance
the child’s heathendom. “It’s no use for you to
tell me different, Reuben,” she would argue. “Her
mother was a heathen, or Injun” (the two were
synonymous in Aunt Mean’s mind), “and do what
we can, the girl will allers be half a savage.”</p>

<p>So Chee—in spite of her aunt’s arguing, decidedly
a whole person—was allowed to spend one or
two days of every week with her friends.</p>

<p>From chords and scales, she learned to pick out
simple tunes, those she heard at church being her
chief source of selection. After awhile she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
learned to play little melodies of her own composing.
“Wind and bird songs,” she called them.</p>

<p>The clergyman gave her all the rules for violin-playing
he knew, and his wife taught her to read
music.</p>

<p>They were happy times for Chee,—Mrs. Green
at the piano, playing old, familiar hymns, Chee
picking out the notes on the minister’s violin.</p>

<p>One day she said, “Some way, Mr. Green, I can’t
love your fiddle like I do Daddy’s.” Then fearing
she might hurt her good friend’s feelings, she hastened
to add, “It’s very much shinier, and of
course it’s a fiddle.” Mrs. Green used to wonder
if “fiddle” wasn’t the most beautiful word in all
the world to Chee.</p>

<p>Three years passed without much change except
Chee’s gradual improvement and increasing delight
in her music.</p>

<p>In Aunt Mean’s best parlor, a hymn-book lay
in prim stateliness beside the family Bible. It
was a coveted treasure to Chee. But the principle
of strict honesty was a part of her very soul, in
spite of her “heathen” mother, and the Bible was
never left alone to gather dust.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>Much to her displeasure, she was “broke in.”
But in time she took her household duties as a
matter of course, and things went on much in the
same old way.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI.</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ONCE Chee suffered a great scare. The whole
secret of her violin threatened to come out.</p>

<p>Neighbor Flannigan often stayed with his cronies
at the “Corners” a little too long for his own good.
One night, being even less himself than usual, he
stumbled into the Whittaker place instead of his
own. Too stupid to reach the house, he threw
himself down on the grass.</p>

<p>As the effect of his evening’s carousing began
to wear off, he was startled by the sound of strange
music. Seemingly it came from the Whittaker
attic.</p>

<p>For awhile he was charmed. What could it
be? More and more the mystery of it impressed
him. At last frightened by his own ignorant conjectures,
he became certain the old house was
haunted, and as fast as his shaky legs could carry
him he started home on a run.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>The following morning he felt it his duty to
confide in Uncle Reuben. “I was jest that tired
from me day’s woruk I had to rest me legs a spell,—you
know how it is yourself, Mr. Whittaker,—when
thim unairthly sounds blowed up softly loike,
roight out of the chimbly.”</p>

<p>“What in the world could the fellow have
heard?” asked Uncle Reuben at breakfast.</p>

<p>“Heard? Why, the whiskey rattling his brain,”
replied Aunt Mean. “Don’t look so frightened,
Chee. It’s wicked to believe in ghosts, and I don’t
want you to get no sech notions in your head.”
Perhaps Aunt Mean was giving orders to herself
as well as to her niece.</p>

<p>That night Chee scarcely dared play, and it was
many a day before her old confidence returned.
The full, round tones she loved were stealthily
smothered. Fortunately, the house was well back
from the road. No neighboring farms were within
hearing distance, so her scare was finally forgotten.
However, something else happened which caused
Chee to leave Daddy Joe’s fiddle in silence a long
time. It was Cousin Gertrude’s coming to the
farm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>Chee wore her pink gingham the day she came,
and even Aunt Mean was dressed up in a white
apron.</p>

<p>“She’s the gayest thing, with dancin’ blue
eyes, and yellow hair and pink cheeks, ’stead of
brown ’uns,” with unnecessary emphasis on the
“brown.”</p>

<p>Tears stole down the “brown” ones at this
remark by Aunt Mean, who was tightly tying
Chee’s braids with bits of shoe-strings. (It was a
grief to Chee that Aunt Mean should not allow her
to braid her own hair.)</p>

<p>“Our Father made my face brown,” she kept
thinking. “He wanted it so.” Yet something
seemed to have dulled the brightness of the
morning.</p>

<p>“I ’spect she’ll call me Ugly Nut, too, like Aunt
Mean used to,” mourned Chee. She had never
attended school, and though her secluded life made
her an old child in some ways, it kept her wonderfully
baby-like in others. Indeed, it is doubtful if
years of learning or contact with wise people could
ever take away her simple, questioning-like manner.
It might always be “Chee’s way.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>Soon the carriage wheels were heard on the gravel
drive, and sad thoughts were quickly put away in
the excitement of Cousin Gertrude’s arrival.</p>

<p>Yes, she was, as Aunt Mean had said, a “gay
thing.” At least, so it seemed as she flew about
the house, visiting old nooks and corners, or out
calling the chickens and feeding Fanny and the
colt.</p>

<p>It was all very startling to Chee,—her lively
movements, her merry repartee, and her show of
affection. It seemed so natural for Cousin Gertrude
to lean her fair head against Uncle Reuben’s
shoulder. Chee would have felt extremely strange
in such an act, even if she were tall enough to
reach it. And as for laughing right up into Aunt
Mean’s face, as though sharp words were only a
joke between them, it would have been impossible
for Chee to have tried it.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, when she found her pretty
cousin sitting idle in the little grove behind the
house, there was a change.</p>

<p>The lips that had all day been parted in laughter
were drooping. Her blue eyes were watching the
hill-tops as though they saw something very sad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
over there. At sight of Chee they brightened a
little.</p>

<p>“Come here, you tiny witch,” she called, making
room in the hammock. “Do you know you make
me think of a poem I read once called ‘The Nut-Brown
Maiden.’”</p>

<p>Chee’s eyes were shyly raised. “Nut-Brown
Maiden is ever so pretty,” she said. “Aunt Mean
used to call me ‘Ugly Nut,’ but my daddy was here
then and he stopped her. Now she calls me
‘Chee.’”</p>

<p>“How odd! I like it, though. Is it an Indian
name?” It seemed to the little girl her cousin
must love Indian names, she spoke so tenderly.
How good it was not to feel in disgrace!</p>

<p>“My real name is Opechee. They call me
Chee, for short. Aunt Mean says ‘it doesn’t holler
so loud of Indian wigwams.’”</p>

<p>“‘Holler of wigwams,’” echoed Gertrude. “You
poor, darling child.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t mind so much, for I know what it
means,” murmured Chee, as she smiled up into
the deep blue sky. “A song-bird—I’d rather be
that than anything else.” Then turning with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
something of Cousin Gertrude’s own impulsiveness,
she asked, “Oh, isn’t it lovely? You can’t know
how glad I am it’s my name.”</p>

<p>No, the girl could not understand Chee’s strange,
almost unreasonable pleasure, but to see the little
one so happy could but lighten her own heart.</p>

<p>Many a long talk had they together in that little
grove, and during their rambles over the farm.
At times Chee would be tempted to unburden her
heart of its secret, but, young as she was, she knew
Cousin Gertrude had a secret, too; for often when
they were talking of the happiest things, the
sparkle would die out of the big blue eyes that
Chee so lovingly watched.</p>

<p>“Cousin Gertrude has forgotten all about her
Nut-Brown Maiden,” she would think. “She
doesn’t tell me her secret, and I won’t tell her
mine.”</p>

<p>And yet before autumn both secrets came out.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ONE night Chee was feeling very lonely for
Daddy Joe’s fiddle—more lonely than any
night since Cousin Gertrude had been at the farm.
It seemed years since she had fingered its dear old
strings. She had been very much discouraged that
last time. Knowing so well the tones she longed
to hear, though she had done her best, she was dissatisfied.
Even now she could feel the thrill that
entered her soul at the concert, three long years
ago.</p>

<p>“If I could only play that way how happy I’d
be. I wouldn’t care any more about Aunt Mean,
nor my face, nor feel the aching so for Daddy Joe,
nor anything.”</p>

<p>Chee was troubled with these mournful thoughts
when she suddenly became conscious that some one
near was crying—very softly, but surely crying.</p>

<p>There was an opening which had been cut<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
through for a register from Chee’s room to the
“best room” below.</p>

<p>“It must be Cousin Gertrude, and something
awful must be the matter to make anybody big
cry almost out loud.”</p>

<p>She could not endure it long, just to lie still and
listen. Creeping down the front stairs, she noiselessly
entered the best bedroom, and slipped her
hand into Gertrude’s.</p>

<p>“Why, Childie, how came you here?” The
young lady tried to speak as though tears were not
even then rolling down her cheeks.</p>

<p>“To comfort you,” was the simple explanation.</p>

<p>For a moment, big blue eyes looked yearningly
into little black ones, then dropped, and tears stole
from under quivering lashes.</p>

<p>Chee crept closer. “Wouldn’t it help you to
tell me about your secret?” she asked, sobbingly.</p>

<p>Cousin Gertrude took the little girl in her arms.
Sitting on the bed she rocked her gently back and
forth, as though to quiet the would-be comforter
herself.</p>

<p>“It was because I was angry. I know it. I
am all to blame. Who had a better right to tell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
me of my faults? But I had been abroad and he
hadn’t, and he made me so indignant. I’ve such
an awful temper, Birdie, you must never let yours
run away with you.”</p>

<p>Chee was frightened at her cousin’s sudden outburst
of confidence, but, with characteristic intuitiveness,
she said nothing.</p>

<p>“I forgot that his feelings were just as hard to
manage, and I threw it down and declared I would
never touch it again as long as I lived. And then
he said he would never speak to me again until I
had taken back my words.</p>

<p>“Then the carriage came—oh, why didn’t it
wait a little longer? I would surely have come to
my senses in another minute. But I left him and
came here. Yet Birdie, Birdie, wouldn’t I touch
it now if I could—if it wasn’t at home and he
far, far away!</p>

<p>“Oh, why did I lose my temper? How could I?
They always said we were both too hot-headed to
get on together. And now all is lost forever, he’s
gone—he won’t come back. Oh, I can never,
never forget this night.”</p>

</figure>

<p>The girl ceased her wild, mournful speaking and
buried her face in her pillow. Uncontrolled sobs
shook her form.</p>

<p>Chee was bewildered. She could not understand
Gertrude’s trouble, but her cousin’s misery had
become hers. Her fingers trembled while she
stroked the bright hair, trying to think of the
right thing to say. Soon Cousin Gertrude was
quiet. Chee thought her asleep, when a long,
quivering sigh escaped. It seemed almost a
sob.</p>

<p>Chee had wanted to say something which she
had hardly dared; this last sign of grief now gave
her courage.</p>

<p>“Cousin Gertrude,” she ventured, in a whisper,
her lips close to the other’s hot cheek.</p>

<p>“Yes, Birdie.”</p>

<p>“Would—would—shall I ask Our Father—to
make it better?” The moonlight was falling
clear on Chee’s upturned face. Her eyes shone
softly, their usual glittering brightness mellowed.
Her long black hair appeared blacker than ever
as it fell upon the whiteness of her night-robe.</p>

<p>A feeling of awe came over the older girl. “Can
this be the same child,” she meditated, “who with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
expressionless features obeys Aunt Mean’s abrupt
commands? Can this be the same little girl who
once blushed to tell me her Indian name—this
tiny being so strong and trustful, who looks now as
though bringing a message from the angels, if she
be not one herself? Shall I tell her God cannot
help, that I have brought my own trouble upon
myself, and I only am to blame?”</p>

<p>But the longer those eyes looked their message
into hers, the more unwilling she became to speak
this bitterness. “She is but a child, after all. I
will not dim the brightness of a faith so beautiful.”
Finally she answered, in a low and tender voice,
“Yes, Birdie, you may ask Him.”</p>

<p>“Then good night, Cousin Gertrude.” A kiss—and
the little comforter was gone.</p>

<p>The next day Gertrude did not leave her room.
She had told Aunt Mean that a severe headache
made her feel weak. Chee thought she might
honestly have said “heartache.”</p>

<p>The little girl cheerfully waited on the sufferer,
but when once outside the best bedroom, her face
was very sober.</p>

<p>“Of course Our Father will make it all right<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
soon, ’cause I asked Him to be very quick, but I do
wish so hard He’d let me help.”</p>

<p>Finally the long day drew to a close. Aunt
Mean and Uncle Reuben retired. Chee again returned
to Gertrude.</p>

<p>She was in the parlor. It was very dark in
there, even the dim twilight was shut out. Chee,
following Cousin Gertrude’s voice, found her sitting
by the window.</p>

<p>She threw open the blinds. She could not bear
to think her friend was sitting alone in the dark.</p>

<p>“Cheer up, Birdie, I shall be better soon,” said
the girl at sight of Chee’s sorrowful face. But
even while she tried to speak gaily, she looked so
pale and worn it saddened the little cousin.</p>

<p>Chee started up-stairs, then turning, came slowly
back and hesitatingly whispered, “I’ve told Him
all about it. He’s surely heard. It’ll be all right
pretty soon.”</p>

<p>“Yes, my comforter,” was the only reply.</p>

<p>Up in her own room, how Chee longed for Daddy
Joe’s fiddle. “I know I could make real music
to-night—I know I could,” she told herself. “I
am sure it would be real, but it would never do;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
I mustn’t, cause then my secret wouldn’t be mine
any more.”</p>

<p>But the temptation increased, until she resolved
to bring out her treasure and look at it. “Just
look at it and hold it.” That would give a little
joy.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">ABOUT sundown, as the people of Chesterfield
say, the train drew into the village. At the
station a gentleman stepped off, left his travelling-case
at the hotel near, and sauntered up the
street.</p>

<p>“Here, Bub,” he called to an urchin who, with
his hands in his pockets, his legs apparently too
long for his trousers, stood eyeing the stranger
from the store doorway, “can you tell me if there
is a person by the name of Reuben Whittaker residing
in this town?”</p>

<p>“Guess you want—Miss Mean’s—brother
Reuben—don’t you?” he replied intermittently,
while severely intent upon chewing gum. “She
lives—out—to the Bend.”</p>

<p>“Is it far?”</p>

<p>“Nope—not more’n—four miles. You just
go straight—on, till—you get there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>“Well, that’s quite a walk, but I guess I’ll try
it. Want a nickel?”</p>

<p>“Nope. Pop don’t ’low—no pay for—common
p’lite—says its—due our country—of her
cit’zens.”</p>

<p>“Queer little chap, that,” mused the traveller.
“Pity the rest of us don’t have more citizen politeness.”
The man’s face was rather haggard. Several
times as he strode along the little path, pulling
at the daisies by its edge, he heaved a long sigh.</p>

<p>“I’ve given in so much,” he said, half aloud to
himself, “she’ll have to give in the rest. How
fiery I was, though! Poor little thing! Well, I’ve
said it, and I’ll have to stick to it now. I suppose
it is all folly my going to the house, but, Great
Scott! what’s a feller going to do? I can’t sleep
nights till I’ve caught a glimpse of her, anyhow.
Maybe she’s ready to give in now. If she doesn’t
of her own accord, it will never do for me to say
anything—never. That dream I had bothers the
life out of me—can’t seem to shake it off. Of
course she’s all right, flying around like a butterfly
this minute, most likely,” and the young man
smiled rather bitterly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>He had come from the city to make sure a girl
was not in trouble, but the thought of her enjoying
herself made him uneasy.</p>

<p>From the village to the “Bend” was, as he had
remarked, quite a distance. In spite of brisk walking
it was nearly dark before his destination was
reached.</p>

<p>“That must be the place,” he thought, quickening
his steps as the white buildings of the Whittaker
farm loomed up in the dusk.</p>

<p>“What in the world shall I do, now I’m here?”
he asked himself, as he paused in front of the
house. “If she’d only come out and take back
her words it would be all right. But goodness!
she’s an awful spunky little thing when she’s once
under way, and it was pretty tough for her. It’s
mighty certain it’s not in her line, but I needn’t
have been quite so hard with her. Hang it all!
what am I going to do now? What in the Dickens
made me come, anyway? Only because I’m such
a fool I couldn’t keep myself away.”</p>

<p>He stood leaning against a tree near one of the
windows. The summer air was very still. Only
occasionally the birds stirred in their nests above<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
his head and murmured sleepily. Once some restless
animal pounded the floor of the barn.</p>

<p>Suddenly a low strain of music startled him.
Did it come from one of the open windows? Timidly
soft it sounded, as though fearing to let itself
be heard—weird and sad.</p>

<p>The man out among the shadows trembled. “Can
that be she? Has she given in?”</p>

<p>The music grew more abandoned. In its sorrow
it seemed to have forgotten its timidity. The
long notes sobbed and moaned, now and then dying
into quieter, more entreating tones. In their tears
they paused and prayed.</p>

<p>The listener was a musician, and the melody
reached the depths of his soul. Facing the window,
he called in a broken voice, “Gertrude.”</p>

<p>The music instantly ceased. A glad cry rang
out, “Herman! my Herman!”</p>

<p>In a second, the man had vaulted the low sill of
the parlor window. He hurriedly glanced around
the room. No musical instrument could be seen,
but a trembling form was steadying itself against
the casing.</p>

<p>“Gertie, poor little Gertie!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>A faint voice answered, “Is it true? Can it be
you? O Herman!”</p>

<p>Again the music rang out. Triumphant peals
this time, strain after strain of tumultuous joy,
clearer and clearer, stronger and stronger, until
the notes could hardly hold their fulness.</p>

<p>In the parlor Gertrude and Herman stood
gazing into each other’s startled eyes.</p>

<p>The wild, rapturous song paused; then breaking
out in steadier notes, even and rich, it gradually
mellowed and hushed until it died away in a whispered
breath.</p>

<p>“It ended like a prayer of thanksgiving,”
said he.</p>

<p>Gertrude caught her breath. “Hush!” She
buried her face in her hands, whispering, “It
was. I see it all now. It must have been little
Chee,—there is no one else.” Lifting her head,
she added, with a strange, new light in her eyes,
“Oh, Herman, she was thanking God for answering
her prayer. I believe it.” And then, half
choked with feeling, she told what she knew of her
little Indian cousin.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX.</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">COUSIN GERTRUDE stole up-stairs. Chee
had heard good-byes a few moments before,
and was hoping, yet fearing, she might find her.</p>

<p>The child sat by the window removing her
stockings. Daddy Joe’s fiddle lay on the bed.</p>

<p>“Birdie, how could you? Oh, how could
you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” answered Chee, in an excited
voice. “I tried not to play out loud, but I got
feeling sorrier and sorrier, and wishing He would
only let me help. And I forgot to play still, and
then I heard a man’s voice, and heard you answer,
and I knew everything was all right, and I was so
happy I just snatched up Daddy’s fiddle and played
out my glad. I didn’t care who heard, for a
minute; and, oh, Cousin Gertrude, I felt it—I
felt it.”</p>

<p>“Felt what, Childie?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>“Why, the music—way down in my heart,
and all over me, just like I did at the concert.
I don’t know what to call it, but it’s something,
and I’ve tried to feel it for such a long time.
And now I have, and it makes me so happy—so
happy, you can’t know. It just makes me glad all
through, and I feel like crying, too.”</p>

<p>“I am as happy as you, my own little Bird.”</p>

<p>Chee’s arms were around Gertrude’s neck, as
she asked, “He did hear, didn’t He?”</p>

<p>“Yes, my comfort, He did hear,” answered
Gertrude, tears again in her voice, “but you
helped Him.”</p>

<p>“I helped Him?” echoed Chee, shaking her
head almost sadly. “No, I wanted to so much,
but He didn’t need me.”</p>

<p>After a little, Gertrude said, “Listen, while I
tell you how you helped—you’ll see He did need
you, after all.</p>

<p>“I love the violin, too—not as you do. I
wanted to play because people expected I would.
I felt too proud to say that, after years of study, I
could never be a great player, and so I kept on
working with one teacher after another. Finally,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
Mr. Farrar, that is my Herman, told me I had
better not spend all my time and money for that
any longer. He said I had come to a place where
I could never go much beyond, and that I wanted
to play more from pride than from love—just
because my parents had decided, when I was
but a child, that music was my first gift. I had
found true what he said, but it made me angry
that he should dare to tell me. I said some words
back. He retorted. We’re both sorry now, but
I was so vexed then, I said I would never touch
the violin again. My temper offended him, his
also rose, and he said he would not speak to me
until I took back my words.</p>

<p>“It was the day I had set to come here. He
was just going to the woods for his vacation, but
he felt so sad he could not go, and went back home
instead. Then one night he had a horrible dream
that troubled him, so he came to see if I was really
safe and well. He says that, down in his heart, he
was hoping I was ready to take back my words.</p>

<p>“While he was wishing so much I would come
to him—he was out under the trees, you know—he
heard music. He thought for a moment I was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
playing, and when he reached me and found out
I wasn’t—well, we were both so glad to be together
again we forgot which one was to blame.
It seemed very silly to have quarrelled at all when
we understood and loved each other so. Anyway,
now we are only glad to be together again and
forget everything. Can’t you see how it might
never have come right if you had not played when
you did?”</p>

<p>Chee made no answer, her heart was full.</p>

<p>“Of course,” she continued, “if he had stopped
to think he would have known it never could have
been my playing,—he knows me so well,—but
he was anxious and didn’t realize. It seemed to
him, he said, the music must be mine, he wanted
so much I should take back my words.</p>

<p>“You did help, my Birdie, but you sha’n’t be
left to sing alone any longer. Oh!” a new light
dawning, “now I know why you love to think
Opechee means a song-bird,” and she kissed the
silent child with new fondness.</p>

<p>“We are going to ride in the morning, my Herman
and I, and when we return perhaps we will
have something to tell you. But oh, my precious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
cousin, you can never, never know all you have
done for us.”</p>

<p>Chee only answered with a grave little shake of
her head, “It wasn’t me, ’twas only Our Father,
and”—she added tenderly—“Daddy Joe’s
fiddle.”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X.</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IN the morning, as he had promised, Mr. Farrar
came to take Cousin Gertrude to drive.</p>

<p>“Chee! Chee! Nut-Brown Maiden, where are
you?” Stepping to the stairway, Gertrude called,
more earnestly, “Birdie, I want you.”</p>

<p>A shy little face peered over the railing, “Please,
Cousin Gertrude, have I <i>got</i> to come down?”</p>

<p>“Why, Chee, wouldn’t you like to? There is
some one here I want you to see.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know, but I’d rather look at him
through the parlor blinds.”</p>

<p>Gertrude showed her disappointment. Chee
watched her and yielded, exclaiming, “Well, you
must be awful proud of him to feel so bad. I suppose
I’d ought to come.”</p>

<p>Cousin Gertrude’s cheeks grew pinker, but she
did not look displeased; she only held out her
hand to Chee. Wondering what she might say to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
put the little girl more at ease, she led her to the
veranda.</p>

<p>A gentleman was standing by the carriage
block, stroking the mane of a horse. At sight of
Chee he quickly removed his hat, as though to
some fine lady. “So this is little Chee,” said he,
“our sweet singer, only she doesn’t really sing, she
plays. Good morning, my dear.”</p>

<p>“Good morning. I don’t know just what to
call you yet. It doesn’t seem quite kind to say
‘Mr. Farrar,’ when you are Cousin Gertrude’s best
friend, does it? She calls you ‘my Herman,’ but
I’m afraid she’d rather I wouldn’t say that, too.”</p>

<p>Mr. Farrar was pleased with this artlessness,
characteristic of Chee, so unlike any boldness, so
like open confidence in one she instinctively recognized
to be worthy. Her voice at such times
seemed to say, “I’ll trust you, you may trust me.”</p>

<p>His eyes twinkled, but he said gravely, seeming
not to notice Gertrude, “Suppose you compromise,
and say ‘our Herman.’”</p>

<p>Chee gave a perplexed glance toward Gertrude.
Suddenly a smile brightened her face, as she exclaimed,
“Oh, I’ve got it. Why didn’t we think<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
before? S’pose I call you ‘Cousin Herman.’” She
gave no opportunity for dissent before adding,
“It’s so much more comfortable, now I know who
you are.”</p>

<p>Cousin Gertrude appeared somewhat confused,
but her friend patted the little girl’s head approvingly,
saying, “Quite right, little Chee, the very
thing, indeed—”</p>

<p>“But Birdie,” hastily interrupted Gertrude, “we
haven’t thanked you yet.” The child cast furtive
glances toward the house. Her companions
changed the conversation. Their eyes, following
hers, had seen others, steel blue, peering through
a lace curtain.</p>

<p>“Is Aunt Mean busy?” asked Gertrude.</p>

<p>After a discreet silence Aunt Mean appeared in
the front doorway. A brief introduction had
scarcely passed before she said, aside to Gertrude,
in low but decidedly distinct tones, “A very likely
young man, my dear, very likely. You showed
good taste. I persume there ain’t a better looking
in our neighborhood,” adding, reflectively, “It’s a
mighty serious business, this gittin’ a man.”</p>

<p>Chee wondered if Aunt Mean spoke from experience,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
and if it wouldn’t have been a very
serious matter indeed if Aunt Mean had ever
attempted to “git” any man other than her
brother. During the embarrassment that followed,
Mr. Farrar found occasion to remark that it was
getting late, and Cousin Gertrude felt obliged to
go for her hat. But before entering the carriage
she managed to whisper to Chee, “Don’t undress
when you go up-stairs to-night—we shall be
home early.”</p>

<p>What a long day it seemed to Chee! How anxiously
she listened for the sound of wheels on the
driveway!</p>

<p>After all she watched in vain, for they had left
the carriage before the Bend was reached. The
first she knew of their coming was a step on the
stairway—very soft, like stocking feet. She
opened the door a little. “Take off your shoes
please, Chee, and come down into the parlor
awhile.”</p>

<p>It was fortunate that the bedrooms occupied by
Miss Almeana and her brother were at the extreme
end of the house. Furthermore, both were slightly
deaf and extraordinarily sound sleepers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>In the parlor the cousins and Mr. Farrar gathered
around Chee’s tin lamp. “And so you have had
no instructor but that minister,” he began. “We
saw him to-day, and, as he himself says, he doesn’t
know much about music. You can read notes, he
tells me.”</p>

<p>“Easy music,” answered Chee, bashfully. The
dreaded ordeal had come—her secret was out.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s good, but how in the world did
you learn to manage the instrument? Who
taught you to hold it, child?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Cousin Herman, I think perhaps
I hold it just as Daddy did, maybe I don’t,
though. It’s so long since I’ve seen him I can’t
be sure.” This last was added a little wearily.
“What has the way I hold Daddy’s fiddle to do
with Cousin Herman?” she wondered.</p>

<p>“It’s just as I say,” exclaimed Mr. Farrar, turning
to Gertrude,—“inherited talent. Probably
the father was only a fair player, but unless I’m
stepping down a peg, the child’s a genius.” Chee
wondered if a genius was something nice, but,
because she disliked to show her ignorance, refrained
from asking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>“Of course the child has run to weeds—it
couldn’t be otherwise. I must hear her play again,
but at all odds she is a musician.” Then turning
suddenly to Chee, he asked, “Where is your violin,
my dear? You must play your best for me, then
Gertrude shall tell you our plan.”</p>

<p>Chee looked frightened, “Why, Cousin Herman,
I couldn’t, she’d hear me—I couldn’t for anything.”</p>

<p>“Who? Oh, I forgot. Well, we’ll have to fix
it somehow. Where have you been playing all
this while? Up attic? What’s the harm now,
then?” So saying, Mr. Farrar proceeded to unlace
his shoes.</p>

<p>Chee was a little tremulous over the undertaking,
but Cousin Herman was firm; so carrying her
small lamp she led the way up the front stairs,
shielding the flickering flame with her hand. The
light fell full upon her excited face. Now and
then she paused in the slow, careful ascent to give
whispered warning where a stair-riser might creak—all
so familiar to her. Mr. Farrar easily
stepped over these places, as did Chee, but, lest
there should be any slight noise and their stealthy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
journey to the attic be disclosed, he assisted Gertrude
over the treacherous places as indicated by
their little Indian guide. When the garret was
reached, Gertrude seated herself on a trunk. Mr.
Farrar leaned against the chimney. Chee lingered
at the railing, anxiously listening.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">“SHE STOOD A MOMENT IN MEDITATION, THE VIOLIN
ALREADY UNDER HER CHIN”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“Chee!” they both impatiently called, at the
same time glancing curiously around.</p>

<p>She approached the familiar hiding-place, and
very slowly drew out the old violin box. Her cheeks
were flushed, and her lips met in a straight line.
A brave determination burned in her eyes. She
realized in a vague way that much depended upon
this effort, but with a pleased, expectant look she
deftly attuned the strings of her instrument.</p>

<p>When this was done, she stood a moment in
meditation, the violin already under her chin,
lightly tapping one foot with the bow.</p>

<p>It was a queer place in which to make one’s
début,—that dusty corner of the old loft. The tin
lamp on a box lighted up the beams hung with long
drooping garlands of cobwebs. Not within reach
of the lamplight, or the pale moonshine coming
through the curtainless windows, huge black<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
shadows gathered around. But the weirdness of
the aspect did not impress Chee; for her a more
familiar spot could not have been chosen. Oh, how
many happy hours she had spent in that dim little
corner!</p>

<p>Soon her meditative position changed, she had
come to a decision, and began to play.</p>

<p>At first, embarrassment hindered her, but before
many notes trembled out on the stillness, she had
forgotten everything except her song.</p>

<p>It was only the old-fashioned air, “Annie
Laurie.” The child must have known the words,
for her music told, even plainer than any words
could tell, the sentiment of the old-time refrain.
Perhaps she had guessed more of her listeners’
state of mind than they knew. However this
may have been, she had chosen well; while the
song lasted, her listeners forgot to be critics—they
were only lovers.</p>

<p>The last strains had scarcely died away, when,
close upon them, followed the opening notes of
“Nearer, My God, to Thee.” If the first piece
had been selected for her audience, this was for
herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>It was her favorite, the one she most often
played. No embarrassment now—with a far-away
expression in her eyes, she gave variation after
variation of the familiar hymn. Suddenly the bow
paused—the note just begun was never finished.
A slight noise came from the stairway. After a
moment of listening, Mr. Farrar crept to the
railing and looked down. Everything was still.</p>

<p>“It must have been only mice,” he said, but
Chee was thoroughly frightened. Nothing could
induce her to continue. At the first sign of alarm
Daddy Joe’s fiddle had disappeared.</p>

<p class="drop-cap2">AFTER Mr. Farrar had bade them good night
and stolen out the front doorway, Gertrude
revealed to Chee their plan.</p>

<p>“We are going to have a concert,” she announced.
“Mr. Green says you haven’t had one
here in town since last Christmas—and we’re
going to get people so interested the whole place
will turn out. Herman knows how, for he has
gotten up several in the city.”</p>

<p>“Get up a concert, why, how can he?” asked
Chee, incredulously.</p>

<p>“He will have a chorus. Every child in the
village must be in that. And he is going to send
for some of his friends,—a man to play the harp,
and a lady to sing, and some others. And Herman,
you know, plays on the piano,—that’s his profession.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>“Oh!” said Chee, in a tone of new understanding.</p>

<p>“But wait, dear, the best part is coming. <i>You</i>
are the best part of all.”</p>

<p>“Me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Birdie, you. That’s what the whole thing
is for. It’s Mr. Green’s idea as much as Herman’s.
It’s to be kept a surprise—I mean you are—your
name won’t appear on the programme at all.”</p>

<p>“My name on the programme! Cousin Gertrude,
what do you mean?” Poor Chee was
thoroughly alarmed now.</p>

<p>“Mean? You dear little monkey, you. Why
nothing at all but that you and your violin are
going to bring down the house.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean my secret has got to come out?”</p>

<p>“Of course. Isn’t it already out? More’s the
pity it has been kept so long.”</p>

<p>“But Aunt Mean! Why, Cousin Gertrude,
what are you thinking of? You know how she
hates it, and calls it wicked.” Chee was almost
in tears.</p>

<p>“Dear Birdie, can’t you see that’s what the
whole thing is for—to cure Aunt Mean of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
nonsense? You know how proud she is—we
think if we can only get her to the hall, that,
after she has heard how beautifully you play and
how fine people think it is, she will give right in.”</p>

<p>“I’m ’fraid she mightn’t—’sides, Cousin Gertrude,
how could I ever play at the hall? I never,
never could do that.”</p>

<p>“Chee,” Gertrude’s face was earnest with pleading,
“you love your little violin, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“You know I love Daddy Joe’s fiddle best of
everything in this world.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you knew that all you ever might
learn about it depended upon whether you played
at the hall or not, couldn’t you do it?”</p>

<p>“Do you mean I could learn to make music like
the man at the concert long ago?” Chee spoke
tremulously, and tears filled her eyes as they looked
up, so full of yearning entreaty.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think you could. If our concert was
a success, so Aunt Mean would let you go, we
would take you to the city with us, where you
could study music to your heart’s content.”</p>

<p>“Go to the city and learn how to play all I
want to!” Chee echoed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>“Can’t you get courage to play at the concert,
now?” The child’s lips compressed for a moment,
then she answered in a whisper, “I don’t believe
she’d ever let me go, but I’ll try.”</p>

<p>“That’s a dear. Don’t you worry about Aunt
Mean. Just wait until my Nut-Brown Maiden
thrills the house.”</p>

<p>Chee shook her head dubiously. “Aunt Mean
never lets anything make her feel as though she
must fly straight to heaven. She can’t,” said
the little girl, translating Gertrude’s words into a
language of her own.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">BUSY weeks followed. Mr. Farrar frequently
came and went—of course to see Gertrude,
but often their afternoon drive together was only
to and from the parsonage gate.</p>

<p>Finally the day for the concert was set. Artists
from a distance were engaged, and the children’s
rehearsal commenced. Chesterfield life had begun
to lag. For the farmers it was less dull than for
the townsfolk, on account of the haying. But gossip
was scarce, and the news of a concert ahead was
a genuine treat.</p>

<p>“Now I wouldn’t snap my fingers to hear the
school youngsters holler, but regular music fellers
from the city—that’s something we don’t get a
chance at every day.”</p>

<p>The choir-leader made this remark with his
usual nasal drawl. The big bulletin of the coming
event was being fastened against the wall of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
post-office. A little knot of men and boys had
gathered around.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know as I could ’zactly afford to
pay for city finery, but as Sadie and Bill are both
a-going to sing, mother ’n’ me cal’ated as how we’d
have to see they did right proper,” replied wee
Sadie’s grandpa.</p>

<p>“Stuff and nonsense,” growled the doctor, as he
peered impatiently at the postmistress, as though
that meek little person was to blame for the tardiness
of a letter, “waste of time and money.” But
the doctor was a bachelor, and “took in the shows,”
so the people said, during his city trips. He was
a gruff man, and though they had often proved
his kind-heartedness in a case of measles, or scarlet
fever, small urchins stepped aside with alacrity as
he passed.</p>

<p>“Some on you is wrong, and some on you is
maybe right,” said Bill Saulswick, the village wag
and philosopher, “but I know good tunes when I
hears ’um; just gimme the sort, be it fiddlin’, or
singin’, or drummin’,—that tells me why I’m
who, and which I’m what, and when I’m where,
and I’ll sit there till the lights go out.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>While the villagers enjoyed the gossip, poor little
Chee was in a whirl of excitement. Her days
seemed a series of ups and downs. At times she
could hardly wait for the great day to arrive, then
in a moment her heart would sink with terror, and
she would hide herself for hours until she had conquered
the temptation to tell Cousin Gertrude she
must break her promise. But she came of a sturdy,
resolute race,—to falter would be worse than to
fail, so she struggled with herself, Gertrude claiming
more and more of her time as the eventful day
drew nearer.</p>

<p>“It do beat all,” Aunt Mean would exclaim, as
from the pantry window she watched the girls go
through the meadow lot, “what Gertrude finds so
entertainin’ about that child. She hasn’t eyes for
nobody but her, gaddin’ off every day, or ridin’ to
town. I should most expect her beau would make
some kind of a row over it.”</p>

<p>For they did “gad off” every pleasant day, sometimes
to the grove to plan, but more often to the
minister’s. There Chee would practise on Mr.
Green’s violin, while Gertrude read or talked with
Mrs. Green.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>A few days before the concert, Mr. Farrar met
them that he might hear, for the last time, Chee’s
piece.</p>

<p>“Cousin Herman, if I play very well indeed, will
you please say ‘yes’ to something?”</p>

<p>“That’s rather broad,” replied the gentleman;
“suppose I can’t say ‘yes.’”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I know you can, just as well as
not.”</p>

<p>“What is it about?”</p>

<p>Chee flushed a little, but answered, smilingly,
“Clothes.”</p>

<p>“Ho, ho, that’s it! Well, I guess I can
go it.”</p>

<p>Mr. Farrar considered himself an apt student of
human nature. “It’s only natural the child should
have a little pride. It’s a good thing Gertrude intends
to see to a gown for her.” So said the young
man to himself, little doubting the exact nature of
Chee’s request.</p>

<p>Satisfied with his promise to say “yes,” the
little girl began to play her chosen piece.</p>

<p>It had taken so long to make a selection from
her old pieces, Cousin Herman had bought several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
new ones—marvels of creation they were to Chee.
“Fixed up with the baby songs all in,” as she
styled the turns and trills. She had tried to play
true to the notes, but it was a hard task. To-day
as she was conscientiously measuring them out,
he left the room a moment to speak with the
minister. Returning, he was surprised at the
progress she had made in his absence. Thinking
his presence had hindered her, he stole softly to
the door.</p>

<p>With a listening expression on her face, Chee
was slowly pacing the floor. The sheet of music
lay on the table, face down. Undoubtedly, as Mr.
Farrar recalled the selection, it was the one she
was playing—but how changed! It seemed to
have been but the framework for the little artist
to build upon.</p>

<p>She finished, and brushing the damp hair from
her warm forehead, looked up. Cousin Herman
stood in the doorway. Chee glanced at the neglected
sheet of music with a guilty look. “I forgot,
Cousin Herman, I really did,” she explained,
hurriedly.</p>

<p>“I guess you needn’t bother with the notes. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
see you have the melody in your head.” He tried
to speak unconcernedly.</p>

<p>Chee was relieved. “I’m ever so glad. You
don’t know how much easier it will be.”</p>

<p>“After you have a teacher I suppose it will be
necessary to tie you down to accurate reading, but
until then we won’t spoil your own way.”</p>

<p>The minister came in just then, followed by his
wife and Gertrude. “Is the lesson over?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Cousin Herman has got to say ‘yes’ now.”</p>

<p>“Say ‘yes?’ What to?”</p>

<p>“That’s just what he hasn’t been told,” replied
Mr. Farrar.</p>

<p>Going to him, Chee drew down his head, that
she might whisper in his ear. He looked perplexed.
A private consultation followed, much to
the amusement of the others in the room.</p>

<p>At first he seemed hard to persuade, but finally
yielded, and Chee left him with a satisfied, “That’s
a good Cousin Herman.”</p>

<p>“Gertrude,” he said at parting, “you needn’t
order Chee’s dress; that matter has already been
attended to.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>Gertrude was not only astonished, she was disappointed,
and started to speak, then checked herself.</p>

<p>“After all, Herman must know what he is about.
I’ll leave it to him.” Gertrude had learned one
lesson; it could not be forgotten soon.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE day of the concert smilingly dawned.</p>

<p>At breakfast, Uncle Reuben surprised them
by saying, “I’m going over the river to-day, Mean.
Don’t you want to go ’long, and stop to George’s?”</p>

<p>Aunt Mean hesitated.</p>

<p>“You kin wear your best bunnet, so’s to stop to
the concert on the way back.”</p>

<p>“Reuben Whittaker! you’re not going to blow
in a single cent on any concert, and you know it.
If Gertrude is foolish ’nough to go and take Chee,
that ain’t none of my business.” Aunt Mean
looked toward her nieces as she spoke, but the
cousins’ eyes were fixed upon their plates.</p>

<p>“Why, Mean,” said Uncle Reuben, mildly, “the
minister says the hull town is going to turn out.
Even—”</p>

<p>“When did you see the minister?” interrupted
his sister.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>“Even Miss Flanigin sent for her sister to take
keer of the young’ns,” continued Uncle Reuben,
without notice of any question. “I never reckoned
on our being behind the Flanigins.”</p>

<p>“Humph! those Flanigins,” was Aunt Mean’s
only comment. But Gertrude noticed, as they
drove away, a bonnet with a purple poppy had won
the day.</p>

<p>“What could have possessed Uncle Reuben to
take her off to-day, of all days?” gleefully questioned
Chee.</p>

<p>“Everything is turning out just right, that’s a
fact,” replied her cousin.</p>

<p>A thought of half suspicion came to Chee. “You
don’t suppose—” she began, impressively, when
Gertrude gave a little cry of pleasure, saying, “If
here doesn’t come Herman, the old dear, and the
house all to ourselves.”</p>

<p>What a day of it they had! With only her two
good friends to watch her, Chee forgot her usual
reserve, and quite surprised them with her happy
chatter. Without the restraint of Aunt Mean’s
practical presence, some of the child’s queer
fancies and odd expressions crept into her talk.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
Until then, Gertrude had but half realized how
truly the little cousin’s nature was made up of the
sensitive perceptions and legendary instincts of her
mother’s people.</p>

<p>Toward evening a thunder-storm threatened.
The three were sitting in Aunt Mean’s plant-room
at the time.</p>

<p>“Grandfather is speaking,” said Chee, pleasantly,
as the first distant mutterings of thunder were
heard. Cousin Herman looked up questioningly.</p>

<p>“Who?” asked Gertrude.</p>

<p>“Grandfather—don’t you hear him?”</p>

<p>Just then a sharp clap rang through the air.
Gertrude held her fingers to her ears.</p>

<p>“That was M’dessun,” said Chee. Then noticing
her companions’ bewildered glances, added,
“It’s very easy to know his voice from grandfather’s
other sons’—he talks so angrily.”</p>

<p>The thunder still roared. Mr. Farrar closed
the plant-room door. “I guess we hadn’t better
sit out here for awhile,” he said, gathering up
Gertrude’s books. “We can come back, it won’t
last long, I think.”</p>

<p>“Don’t go! What made you shut the door?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
I love to hear them,” and Chee stepped out into
the rising storm fearlessly, as though the sky had
been all sunshine.</p>

<p>“Come in, Chee. Oh, do come in!” cried
Gertrude, pale with alarm.</p>

<p>The child ran quickly, and throwing her arms
around her cousin, asked, “Why, are you sick?
What is the matter? Don’t you like Thunder?
He is our grandfather, you know.”</p>

<p>“Is the girl crazy?” asked Mr. Farrar.</p>

<p>“I think she refers to some legend,” answered
Gertrude. Chee had always been interesting; her
personality was felt, even when she was her usual,
reserved little self; to-day, all embarrassment cast
away, she was fascinating.</p>

<p>“We don’t know about it, Birdie; can’t you tell
us?”</p>

<p>“I forgot you didn’t know,” replied Chee.
Then as if in penitence, she added, “I’ll close the
door again, if you’d rather, Cousin Gertrude.”</p>

<p>“No, leave it open. The storm is going around
us. It will be pleasanter soon. Now tell us what
you meant by ‘Grandfather.’”</p>

<p>So Chee began,—the rain dripping from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
roof, and the fresh, purified air blowing in at
the wide-swung door,—“Why, as I said, Thunder
is our grandfather. He has three boys. That
loud, sharp sound that hurt Cousin Gertrude’s
ears was the baby; he is cross and cruel. But
grandfather will never allow him to harm us.
Grandfather lets him kill animals sometimes.</p>

<p>“His other sons are kind, gentle boys; they
never do any harm, but cool the air instead, and
make the earth fresh again. Thunder that just
threatens and mutters is grandfather’s voice.”</p>

<p>“What about lightning?” asked Cousin Herman,
with a twinkle in his eye. “Is that kind
and good?”</p>

<p>Chee laughed. “Lightning? She’s—well, she’s
his wife.” They all laughed at her answer, and
Mr. Farrar mischievously glanced at Gertrude.
Chee noticed that she blushed, but took courage
and added, “There’s an old story about grandfather;
would you like to hear it?”</p>

<p>Of course they were only too glad to keep her
talking, so, clasping her hands around one knee,
she commenced the story—her low, dreamy voice
fitting well with the tale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>“Well, once, years and years ago,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> there were
two Indian homes. In each home there was a
beautiful daughter; they were lovely, good friends,
but they couldn’t see each other very often, for
their wigwams were such a long ways apart. But
one awful hot day, one of them asked her mother
if she couldn’t go and see the other girl, and
her mother said ‘no,’ ’cause she was so pretty.
But the girl teased so hard she had to let
her go.</p>

<p>“She hadn’t gone very far before a tall man
came and walked beside her, and said such nice
things to her she forgot all about where she was
going, until she found right in front of them a
big rock with a hole in it. The man said, ‘This
is where I live. Won’t you come in?’</p>

<p>“She was afraid of the dark, so she wouldn’t go.
But he coaxed, and finally she said she’d go in
if he’d go first. So he went, but just the minute
he got inside, he turned right into an ugly old Wi-will-mecq,
and she was scared most to pieces.”</p>

<p>“May we ask what a ‘Wi-will-mecq’ is?”
asked Mr. Farrar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i091">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i091.jpg" alt="I’VE SAVED YOU FROM THE GREAT WI-WILL-MECQ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">“‘I’VE SAVED YOU FROM THE GREAT WI-WILL-MECQ’”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“It’s a great, horrid worm, and the girl tried to
run away from it, but just then an awful loud
thundering was heard, and she didn’t know anything
more until she opened her eyes in a great
big room with an old man in it.</p>

<p>“He said, ‘I’m your grandfather. I’ve saved
you from the great Wi-will-mecq.’ Then he
showed it to her, out-doors, all chopped up in a
hundred little pieces. He told the girl she must
give him a smoke when he asked for it, to show
she was grateful. Then he sent her home safe
and sound. Do you like that story?”</p>

<p>“Very much,” answered Cousin Herman. “But
I can see from her face that Gertie is wondering
how in the world the girl could give old Thunder
a smoke.”</p>

<p>“The Indians used always to do that after
grandfather was so good to one of their people.
They build a fire out-doors every time grandfather
calls for it, and put some tobacco in it; it goes up
in the smoke, and so he gets it.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Now you see I
couldn’t be afraid, could I?”</p>

<p>Cousin Gertrude patted Chee’s braids. Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
Farrar whistled softly to himself. Chee noticed
that neither answered her question.</p>

<p>“Well, anyway,” she exclaimed, her eyes flashing,
“you can ask just as many people as you like,
and every one will tell you that there never was
an Indian or anything he owned killed in a thunder-storm.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
My daddy asked lots of wise people, and
none ever could tell of a single one.”</p>

<p>Mr. Farrar could no longer whistle, his lips
were trying to smile. With a smothered “Ha, ha,”
he hurried out to feed his horse.</p>

<p>Chee was very much displeased. She went to
the open door, and leaning her head against the
casement, looked over the freshened fields. Before
long, Gertrude joined her. Drawing the little girl
to her, she too stood watching the landscape.</p>

<p>“Birdie,” she asked, at length, then hesitated,
as though loath to go on, “do you honestly believe
that pretty little story?”</p>

<p>Chee turned her face toward her questioner, all
resentment gone—that soft light in her eyes, only
there when she was deeply moved.</p>

<p>“Cousin Gertrude, dear,” she answered, looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
clearly into the other’s face, “don’t worry. I
know what you mean. Yes, and no. For the
time I was telling it I believed it. But now when
you ask me, I know quite well that Our Father
sends the thunder, just as He sends the rain when
we need it. Daddy told me so. But anyway, I
shouldn’t be afraid because it’s just the same. He
won’t let anything hurt me. Daddy told me that,
and I think I should know it, anyway. Sometimes
when the breeze blows softly against my cheek,
it tells me so, and if ever I forget, the stars at
night tell me how wrong it is to fear Our Father
who loves us so.”</p>

<p>Cousin Gertrude made no reply, she only held
the little one closer. Chee was not a heathen, but
she was certainly a strange child.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">EVENING came. Mr. Farrar drove Gertrude
and Chee to the minister’s home, and then
hurried to the hotel. Everything looked favorable;
the city musicians had arrived, and the
night promised to be perfect.</p>

<p>Gertrude was already dressed for the entertainment,
but Chee still wore her pink gingham.
“Come, Chee, you won’t have any more than
time,” she urged, anxious to know the contents of
a box Chee had brought. “Don’t you want some
help?”</p>

<p>“I’ve tried it on before,” answered the little girl,
as she tugged up-stairs with her package.</p>

<p>Eight o’clock drew near. The street in front
of the hall was filled with farmers’ vehicles and
passing townsfolk. Inside was the important
bustle of ushers rushing to and fro, and the sound
of instruments being tuned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>As the moments passed, the throng grew dense.
Fans seemed to sway the audience back and forth.
At last the curtains rose—the house was packed.</p>

<p>The chorus of white-clad children lifted its
voice. It was a good chorus—the finest of which
Chesterfield had ever boasted. Sadie’s grandpa
was satisfied. The village philosopher’s psychological
chart was being revealed to him. Even the
doctor was elated. Beside him, sat “Cit’zen P’liteness,”
which coincidence might have been fortunate
for the boy, who more than once, in extreme
excitement, choked and nearly swallowed his gum.</p>

<p>The musicians did their best. The people demanded
encore after encore. It grew late. The
enthusiasm lulled. Little children slept in their
parents’ arms; here and there a fretful one cried
out.</p>

<p>A hush fell over the stage, and people waited
uneasily; children became still more impatient;
the very air grew intense. A young lady near the
front was faint—it was the one with blue eyes
and golden hair. Soon a soft step was heard. All
eyes were again fastened on the stage.</p>

<p>A small, brown-faced girl stood near the centre.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
She was dressed in gay Indian clothes; her long
black unbraided hair fell nearly to her knees;
bright beads were twined about her neck and
arms; bare ankles showed above wee moccasins.
In one hand she carried a small red violin and
a long bow.</p>

<p>The people were too much interested to applaud.
All strove for a better view of the dark,
flushed face before them.</p>

<p>Catching sight of the golden-haired young
woman, the child’s lips parted in a smile. Caressingly
she put the violin under her arm, and
nodded encouragement. The white face of her
friend banished, for a moment, her own timidity.</p>

<p>The audience took this act of recognition to
themselves, shouting and clapping again and again.
The small face grew frightened, but the sight of
a certain purple poppy, nervously bobbing among
the sea of heads, restored its bravery. The little
maid tucked the instrument beneath her chin.
The confusion ceased.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i097">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i097.jpg" alt="IT WAS AS THOUGH ALL THE PLAINTIVE STORY OF A

CASE">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">“IT WAS AS THOUGH ALL THE PLAINTIVE STORY OF A
DYING RACE HAD BEEN STORED IN THAT LITTLE RED
CASE”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>With her eyes uplifted, as though listening, she
drew the bow across the strings—first tremblingly,
then lovingly, and, finally, triumphantly.
Once only her eyes lowered, sought the purple
poppy, and lifted again. With more and more
feeling came the music. It was as though all
the plaintive story of a dying race had been
stored in that little red case. Their hardships
and sorrows; their wild life of the woods, the
lakes, and the prairies; their weird chants and
incantations; their joys and pinings now sobbed,
now sung at the touch of small brown fingers.</p>

<p>Not a person stirred; even the children grew
intent; for a moment the fans were poised;
breathlessly the people listened. The music
ceased. Tears were on cheeks fair and seamed.</p>

<p>A man appeared before the platform. It was
Mr. Green, the minister. “Our little townswoman
has been requested to render, as a special
favor, that beloved melody, ‘Nearer, My God, to
Thee.’” He spoke with earnestness, and retired
immediately.</p>

<p>A strange expression came over the small musician’s
face, a look so reverent, so pure, that the
audience leaned forward in their seats. With an
upward, yearning glance the child began to play.</p>

<p>If before, the dazzling, fantastic garb of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
player had blended with the dreamy legends of
her tender music, not so now; none looked at the
girl save unconsciously to watch her face. Each
person felt alone in holy communion with the
music which descended as from heaven itself to
the depths of their souls.</p>

<p>These strains spoke not of the forest, nor of the
sea. They rung out in condemnation; they plead
with tender reproachfulness; they swept through
each soul, causing it to vibrate the notes in very
sympathy with themselves, but it was always
“Thou and me,” to each heart the world was
not.</p>

<p>The notes died away. A great sigh arose from
the audience. The curtain fell, and quietly the
concourse of people dissolved. There was no
crowding, no laughter; there was little talk. As
from a temple the people passed slowly out.</p>

<p>“Was it the instrument? Who can tell?”
The clergyman asked himself that question.
Cousin Herman asked it. Many others queried
over it.</p>

<p>It may have been. Who can tell? Strangely
enough, no one ventured to ask the little half-breed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
Had they done so, she doubtless would
have answered, in her reverent way, “It was not
me. It was just Our Father,” surely adding, “and
Daddy Joe’s fiddle.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">TIME has passed. Though Aunt Mean and
Uncle Reuben still live at the Bend, years
have left their traces. They rest now through the
day in their armchairs. Their faces are happy—far
happier than in the old hard-working days.</p>

<p>Aunt Mean’s strong-minded features soften as
she talks to Reuben, through his ear-trumpet, of
the long ago.</p>

<p>“You were always a good woman, Mean,” he
answers, soothingly. How love forgets its hardships
and recounts its joys.</p>

<p>“I wasn’t no heathen, brother, but I was only
half converted until that night.”</p>

<p>“We was all revived,” gently replies Uncle
Reuben, “even the minister. Bless his soul, he’s
got his reward for goodness now.”</p>

<p>“Hush! she’s coming.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>Footsteps sound upon the stairs. A sweet, low
voice mingles with the Irish brogue of Biddy in
the kitchen.</p>

<p>Soon a slight, middle-aged woman, dressed in
black, enters the room. Her face tells of grief
borne patiently, of joy from a trustful heart.
Mrs. Green brings an open letter.</p>

<p>“From the children?”</p>

<p>“Yes, auntie. The little ones are all well.
Herman has promised them a trip to the farm
at Easter. Gertrude’s cold is better. They
enclosed a letter from Chee.”</p>

<p>And so together they sit in the lamplight,
lingering over their weekly pleasure—the children’s
letter.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Most old places have their ghost stories. The
Whittakers’ at the Bend is not an exception.
Long ago the incident happened, but to this day
neither of the old people are fond of the attic.
Even the creaking stairway brings to Aunt Mean’s
mind sad strains of music.</p>

<p>“Of course it was my guilty conscience, but, that
night when I got up with a cramp, and heard the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
same old tune that poor Joe played the day before
he died, it seemed as though my bones was frozen
stiff.</p>

<p>“If I’d only done as you done, Reuben, and gone
straight to the minister’s, it would have saved me
nights of agony. Lots of times I used to hear
them sounds after all but me was sound asleep.
But I never dared get up. I’d hide my head
underneath the bedclothes, and pray the Lord if
He would only forgive me my hardness against
poor Joe and his child, I’d do anything in the
world.</p>

<p>“Ah, them was hard days, and that was a
strange night, when I see the child and the fiddle
on the platform, and the hull thing come over me
like a streak of lightning.”</p>

<p>“’Twas the Lord’s way, Mean, my girl, and we
won’t find no fault.”</p>

<p>“No, Reuben, and though you ain’t the one to
say it, in your heart you’re mighty glad I’m a
different woman from them days. I say it myself,
as oughtn’t to.”</p>

<p>“You’re not the only one, Mean. ’Twas all the
Lord’s doin’s.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>And Chee? Few know her by that name, or
even the story of her birth and childhood.</p>

<p>In a far-off city, surrounded by luxury that
wealth may buy, amid flattery that fame may bring,
a certain celebrated musician still hears the echo of a
little child’s plaintive prayer: “And if Thou do, I’ll
do something for Thee sometime, only I can’t think
of anything now. Thy kingdom come. Amen.”</p>

<p>It is Sabbath Day. As the twilight is falling
over the streets of that far-off city, you may enter
the wide doors of a great building.</p>

<p>Many people of different nationalities reverently
tread its dim aisles. The turmoil of life is forgotten
in the hush of this peacefulness.</p>

<p>While you wait, a strain of tender music
breathes softly through the place. The sounds
scarcely break the silence. Stillness itself is given
a voice. The faces about you brighten. Bitter
lines soften; bowed shoulders straighten.</p>

<p>For one glorified hour you listen. And when
the last evangel note has trembled its message to
every part of the vast room, even from the frescoed
dome to the deepest places in the hearts of the
listeners, you silently turn away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>People of different races, speaking different
tongues,—each soul with its own burden, griefs,
or sins,—have all been lifted nearer heaven by
the same voice of lingering music.</p>

<p>Is it a wonder that no other instrument, however
precious, can say to weary hearts, “He is sure to
have heard; it will be all right pretty soon,” as
Daddy Joe’s fiddle?</p>
